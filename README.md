# boostGraph

This project illustrates the use of Boost Graph Library.

Graphviz is required to display the graphs with dot format.
To install graphviz on Ubuntu :
sudo apt-get install graphviz

In the main program, the file inverterGraph.dot is read to build a Boost Graph which is then displayed using Graphviz.
